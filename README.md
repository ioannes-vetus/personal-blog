## Writing a blog post

Add a new Markdown file under `blog/`, named `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, with front matter like:

```md
---
slug: my-post
title: My Post
authors: [author]
tags: [general]
---

Preview text shown in the blog list.

<!-- truncate -->

The rest of the post, only shown on the full post page.
```

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which checks formatting, builds the site, and
deploys it to GitHub Pages at `https://ioannes-vetus.github.io/personal-blog/`.

## Commit messages

Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g.
`feat: add contact section`, `fix: correct footer color in dark mode`). This is enforced locally by
a pre-commit hook — see below.

## Git hooks

Husky + lint-staged run on every commit:

- Prettier is applied to staged `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}` files
- Commit messages are validated against Conventional Commits via commitlint

Hooks are installed automatically after `yarn install` (via the `prepare` script).
